                <h3>Belts: Typically will always be black, brown, or tan, and made with leather (sometimes suede). Belts should always be the same color as your shoes, and if possible try to match the metal on your buckle with the metal in your watch or other accessories. 
                    Any patterns on belts should be subtle as these are not statement pieces, but rather, finishing touches that bring your whole outfit together.

                <h3>Ties: Generally your tie should be made of silk and darker than your shirt. The more solid and singular colored, the easier it will be to match your tie with your outfit. If you're having difficult matching a tie color to your outfit, see if the inside of your sports jacket has a different color. Typically this inside color is a great color choice for your tie.</h3>

                <h3>Shirts: The safest colors to choose are typically neutral or blue, as these are simple to style and pair. Stick to relaxed and slim fits.</h3>
